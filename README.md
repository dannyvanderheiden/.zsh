# ZSH Settings

This repository contains my ZSH settings.


## Installation

Run the following to install the ZSH settings:

    git clone git://github.com/dannyvanderheiden/.zsh.git ~/.zsh

    cd ~/.zsh

    ./script/install

The installation will symlink the available dot files.

First get the latest version:

    cd ~/.zsh
    git pull origin master


Run the installation, which will automatically install the new dot files.

    cd ~/.zsh
    ./script/install
